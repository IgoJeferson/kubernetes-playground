## Kubernetes Web UI

- Kubernetes is great, but sometimes a web is is useful, too
    - Called the "Dashboard UI"
- Runs on your Kubernetes master(s)
- Accessible directly if you have direct network connectivity directly to
your cluster/master(s) (unlikely in production situations)
    - kubeclt can create a proxy/tunnel for you in situations you do not
    $ kubectl proxy


- Provides a variety of views for nearly anything in your Kubernetes cluster
- Allows update, deletion, and creation of nearly anything in your Kubernetes cluster
- Accesses the same APIS as kubeclt

- On some Kubernetes clusters the Dashboard UI is pre-installed, on some it is not (many cloud providers'
Kubernetes services include it)

- Installing the Dashboard
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-rc2/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml

- Accessing the Dashboard (the most fool-proof way)
$ kubectl proxy

- Navigate to "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/" in your web browser


## Getting token with kubectl

There are many Service Accounts created in Kubernetes by default. All with different access permissions. 
In order to find any token, that can be used to login we'll use kubectl:

- Check existing secrets in kubernetes-dashboard namespace
$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret

$ kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secrets kubernetes-dashboard-token-{code}

-- We can now use printed token to login to Dashboard.
