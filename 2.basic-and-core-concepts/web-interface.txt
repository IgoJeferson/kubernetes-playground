## Kubernetes Web UI

- Kubernetes is great, but sometimes a web is is useful, too
    - Called the "Dashboard UI"
- Runs on your Kubernetes master(s)
- Accessible directly if you have direct network connectivity directly to
your cluster/master(s) (unlikely in production situations)
    - kubeclt can create a proxy/tunnel for you in situations you do not
    $ kubectl proxy


- Provides a variety of views for nearly anything in your Kubernetes cluster
- Allows update, deletion, and creation of nearly anything in your Kubernetes cluster
- Accesses the same APIS as kubeclt

- On some Kubernetes clusters the Dashboard UI is pre-installed, on some it is not (many cloud providers'
Kubernetes services include it)

- Installing the Dashboard
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-rc2/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml

- Accessing the Dashboard (the most fool-proof way)
$ kubectl proxy

- Navigate to "http://localhost:8001/ui" in your web browser

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/
