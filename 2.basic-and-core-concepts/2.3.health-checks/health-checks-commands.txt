## Health Checks

- Kubernetes has two types of health checks to ascertain two different things
    - Readiness Probes: To determine when a Pod is "ready" (e.g after it has started to see when it's 
    ready and has loaded what it needs to internally in the image and is ready to take requests from
    external services)

    - Liveness Probes: To determine when a Pod is "healthy" or "unhealthy" after it has become ready

- Whether they are a readiness or liveness probe they can be use a variety of methods to ascertain a 
container's status
    - Successfull HTTP or TCP request to the Pod
    - Successfull command execution on the Pod

- Probes are defined on the container in a Deployment or Pod specification

# Making it real: A Healthy Tomcat

- A readiness probe will check to make sure the Pod has started and is ready to begin taking requests
- A liveness probe on the Tomcat deployment will help us ensure the containers continue to be able to 
accept and service requests without error is a reasonable amount of time


- To apply 
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
